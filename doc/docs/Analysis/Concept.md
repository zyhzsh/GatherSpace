# Concept

## Ideas of origin

It is a common practice, among my associates, to share and request photos and videos after attending events, holidays, family gatherings, etc. My sister, who is a mother of three, also encounters this issue. Upon her return from an event, her WeChat/WhatsApp is inundated with images and videos shared by others. Although this is a convenient method of sharing, it presents difficulties in organizing and contextualizing these memories, making it difficult to recall the emotions and thoughts associated with each moment. This is an issue that I have experienced as well, despite not being an avid user of social media.

As a result, I have been contemplating the creation of an application or website that would address this challenge. I envision using the knowledge and skills I have gained in my previous academic term to develop a scalable solution.

## The basic problems and requrements

To further solidify the concept, I took some time to reflect on the issues and challenges that this project aims to resolve. The following image displays my general thoughts on the matter.

In general, the software solution should address the following key challenges:

- Address the difficulty of sharing photos, videos, and thoughts after an activity.
- Address the difficulty of finding photos, videos, and thoughts after an activity.
- Address the difficulty of recalling memories through photos and videos (Aftertaste, Reminiscence).

Additionally, considering my learning objectives, the solution should:

- Be scalable.
- Have a limited budget, so cost-effectiveness should be a consideration in the development process.

## The though of product positioning and business value

Of course, there are numerous solutions available in the market that address the outlined challenges in various ways. The following image displays some examples.

The aforementioned products have their own unique positions in the market. While they may address some of the previously discussed challenges, they do not provide a comprehensive or straightforward solution, requiring the user to put in a certain amount of effort to achieve the desired outcome.

The primary goal is to offer a solution that enables users to easily share and preserve memories from family, friend, school, or other life events for a long period of time.

The product is not:

- A social media platform like Facebook, Twitter, or Weibo.
- A content-sharing platform like YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.
- A pure photo management and sharing cloud storage service like Google Photos.
- An event ticket selling or gathering social party platform like Eventbee.

Instead, it is:

- A platform where people can safely share memories with those they know.
- A platform where people can leave their thoughts about events or others' posts.
- A platform where people can easily manage and revisit their memories from life events.

Thus, the product is positioned in a sweet spot between social media, event hosting, and photo sharing.

The profit model for the product requires further analysis as it operates as a pure internal sharing platform, with no apparent room for profit. Research and analysis are needed to determine how to make people, schools, companies, and other institutions pay for the service.
