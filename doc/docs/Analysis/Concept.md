# Concept

## Ideas of origin

It's commonly happening for me, at least the people I know, who are willing to share/ask for photos and videos after returning from an event, holiday, family gathering, etc.

My sister is a mother of a three-year-old child. Every time she returned from an event, her WeChat/WhatApps were always drowned by photos and videos. It works fine to share these photos and videos via a chat app. But it's not handy when she wants to organize the images and videos. And one day, when she wants to look back at those memories, it just loses the context. It isn't easy to let her recall how she or her friends thought and felt about the moment.

The same experience happened to me as well, and, I am not a person who loves spending time photographing and posting them on social media, but I still want to see them and know what people think about them. Besides, someone must be keen on sharing and posting or making a scrapbook for themselves. Besides, someone must be willing to share, post, or create a scrapbook.

Therefore, I was asking myself: Is it possible to make an application or website to help solve this problem?
More importantly, I could practice the knowledge I have learned from the previous semester to build a scalable solution.

## The basic problems and requrements

To further enhance the ideas behind it, I took a couple of minutes to think about some issues or problems that this project will resolve. The picture below shows some general thoughts I had.

With the ideas above, in general, the software solution should be capable of solving the following:

- Solved the user's difficulty sharing photos, videos, and thoughts after an activity.
- Solved the user's difficulty finding photos, videos, and thoughts after an activity.
- Solved the user's difficulty recalling their memory via photos and videos. (Aftertaste, Reminiscence)

Combined with my learning goal, it should aslo include:

- The solution should be scalable.
- There are not many budget for this project, so try to reduce the amount of cost is needed.

## The though of product positioning and business value

Off course, there are many existing solutions on the market could solved the problem in various ways.  
Here are some examples in the diagram below.

The products mentioned above have their positioning. These products can solve some of the problems discussed previously but don't provide a complete or straightforward solution. Therefore, the users must go through a certain degree of study/effort to achieve the desired outcome.

Back to the original intention, the goal is to provide a solution that helps the user easily share the joy kept in the memory for a long time after/during family, friends, school, or any other gathering life event.

So the product is not:

- a social media like facebook ,twitter, weibo.
- a content-sharing platform like youtube, tiktok or instagram.
- a pure photo management and sharing cloud storage like google photos.
- an event ticket selling or helping people to join a gathering social party platform like eventbee.

It is:

- where people can safely share their memory with the people they know.
- where people can leave their own words about the event or others' posts.
- where people can easily manage and bring back their nostalgia from a life event from time to time.

Therefore, the position is located on a bit sweetspot between social media,event hosting,and photo sharing.

The part about the profit model may need further analysis because it sounds like a pure internal sharing platform, and there seems to be no room for profit.
How to make people or schools, companies, and other institutions pay for this service needs further research and analysis.
